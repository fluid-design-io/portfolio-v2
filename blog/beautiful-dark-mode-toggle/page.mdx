Websites nowadays are using dark mode as a default theme. It is a trend that is here to stay.
Not only does it look cool, it also helps reduce eye strain and battery consumption.
Also, having the ability to switch between dark and light mode is a great way to add user experience to your website.
This article will show you my approach to creating a beautiful dark mode tooggle with framer motion and tailwindcss.

## Setup

I used codesandbox to create this project. It is a great tool for quickly prototyping and sharing ideas.
Also, you can find the
[Next 13 + TailwindCSS + Framer Motion + Fluid UI template](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/next-13-app-dir-tailwind-framer-starter-1d99zf)
I used for this project.

## Design

The design is pretty simple. We have a circle with a moon and a sun inside.
I used the icons from material design icons and extracted into svg files.
As of the colors, I used `bg-gray-600` for the moon and `bg-gray-100` for the sun.

For the `button` component, I used [@fluid-design/fluid-ui's](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fluid-design/fluid-ui) `Button` component as it'll give us a11y features and hover/active/focus states out of the box.

Here's an example of the `Button` component:

```tsx filename="components/Button.tsx" allowErrors
<Button
  key="light-toggle"
  onClick={toggleMode}
  aria-label="Toggle dark mode"
  whileTap="tap"
  color="gray"
  weight="clear"
  iconOnly
>
  {mode === "light" ? (
    <MoonIcon className="h-6 w-6" />
  ) : (
    <SunIcon className="h-6 w-6" />
  )}
</Button>
```

## Animation

Most of the website I've seen rarely animate the dark mode tooggle.
If they do, they usually just fade the icon in and out.

That is absolutely fine, however, I think there's a lot of room for improvement.

As you can see from TailwindCSS's website, there's no animation when switching between dark and light mode.
In addition, the sudden change in color is a bit jarring. (I will provide potential solutions at the end of this article)

And here comes [framer motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) to the rescue.
It is one of the most popular animation libraries for React.

We can turn any component into a motion component by wrapping it with `motion`, and it requires a few props to **animate** it.

### Motion

The `motion` component is the core of framer motion.

- `initial`: The initial state of the component.
- `animate`: The state of the component when it is **animated**.
- `exit`: The state of the component when it is **exited**.
- `transition`: The transition of the component when it is **animated**.

### Button animation strategy

We actually are using two buttons to toggle between dark and light mode.
After user clicks on the button, we will change the `mode` state to the opposite value.
Then, we will animate the button to the opposite state.

In between, the button wiill **exit** the current state, and the other button will **animate** into the current state.

Here's the code for the `Button` component:

```tsx filename="components/Switch.tsx" allowErrors
<AnimatePresence mode="popLayout" initial={false}>
  <Button
    as={motion.button}
    animate="animate"
    exit="exit"
    initial="initial"
    key="light-toggle"
    onClick={toggleMode}
    variants={buttonVariants}
    aria-label="Toggle dark mode"
    whileTap="tap"
    color="gray"
    weight="clear"
    iconOnly
  >
    {mode === "dark" && (
      <motion.div
        variants={iconVariants}
        transition={{
          type: "spring",
          stiffness: 150,
          damping: 15,
          mass: 0.2,
        }}
      >
        <SunIcon className={clsx("h-4 w-4 fill-gray-100")} />
      </motion.div>
    )}
    {mode === "light" && (
      <motion.div
        variants={iconVariants}
        transition={{
          type: "spring",
          stiffness: 150,
          damping: 15,
          mass: 0.2,
        }}
      >
        <MoonIcon className={clsx("h-4 w-4 fill-gray-600 transition-colors")} />
      </motion.div>
    )}
  </Button>
</AnimatePresence>
// ...
```

### Button variants

The `variants` prop is an object that contains the states of the component.

```tsx filename="components/Switch.tsx"
// ...

const buttonVariants = {
  initial: {},
  animate: {},
  exit: {},
  tap: {
    scale: 0.9,
  },
};
const iconVariants = {
  initial: {
    opacity: 0,
    scale: 0.3,
    rotate: -120,
  },
  animate: {
    opacity: 1,
    scale: 1,
    rotate: 0,
  },
  exit: {
    scale: 0.5,
    rotate: 90,
    opacity: 0,
  },
  tap: {
    rotate: 30,
  },
};
```

### Microinteractions

The logic behind the _spin_ animation is a way to replicate the feeling of sun and moon orbiting around the earth.

As the user **tap** the button, the sun and moon will first rotate 30 degrees, giving the user a sense of _push_ feedback.
And if the user decides to release the button, the sun and moon will rotate & fade (scale in/out), as a way to indicate that the button is **tapped**.

## Conclusion

We learned how to animate a dark mode tooggle with framer motion.
We also learned how to use `AnimatePresence` to animate the component when it is **exited**.
Keep in mind that having the dark mode toggle isn't enough, we will be covering what makes a good **dark mode** experience in the upcoming articles.
