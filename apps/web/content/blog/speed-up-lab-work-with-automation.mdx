Having working in the lab for a while, I have noticed that there are a lot of repetitive tasks that we need to do.
For example, we need to configure a lot of devices with the same configuration.
Every once a while, we'll need to backup the configuration of a lot of devices.
These tasks can be very time consuming.
Automating these tasks can save us a lot of time and effort.

So I decided to automate some of the tasks that I do in the lab.
