With an ellipse brush, coloring is way easier. Customize your brush, eraser, and even your own palette.
Use the filter to choose one of our awesome templates. We’re here to make your coloring experience better.
Save your work, keep your own portfolio, share with the community, and view others’ work to enrich your art world!

## Hierarchical Task Analysis tree

![Analysis Tree](/assets/blog/ux-research-drawing-app/analysis-tree.webp)

One difference between Sam and Oliver was the concept of being digital and physical while doing tasks.
Oliver’s interpretation of digital and physical is based on the type of artwork (via software or paper & ink).
Sam’s interpretation was based on the sharing format, where it doesn’t matter what medium the work was done on.
The way Eunice gets inspiration to draw was different from others. For a subtask of drawing a penguin, Sam and
Oliver mentioned that they search for penguin images or videos online to see the realistic view of penguins. However,
in Eunice’s case she usually gets inspiration from viewing others’ (art) work. She would like to know more on how people choose the layouts or colors.

## Observational Study Protocol

We followed _Observe user coloring in a coloring book_:

1. (1 min) Introduce ourselves.
2. (1 min) Ask demographic questions to the participant.
3. (1 min) Explain class project.
4. (2 min) Ask about coloring experiences on coloring books:
5. Ever did it before?
6. Any coloring tool (pencil, pen, brush, etc) that you prefer to use when coloring?
7. (2 min) Show an example of coloring on an example drawing.
8. (5-6 min)
   Task A: Given a drawing with outlines only, let them color with a **circle point brush**. Questions to ask: (1) How do you feel as you are coloring?Task B: Now change the tool to a **square point brush**. Questions to ask: (1) Does your experience of coloring change? (2) Is it easier/harder to color?Tack C: Now change the tool to an **ellipse point brush**. Questions to ask: (1) Does your experience of coloring change? (2) Is it easier/harder to color?
9. (3 min) Ask questions about the overall experience:
10. How do you feel about the artwork you created?
11. Which brush was the easiest to color?
12. Which brush was the hardest to color?
13. Was there a part that you found easier to color with a particular brush? Which one?
14. (1 min) Thank them for their time.
15. (1 min) Take a screenshot of their drawing as a record.

## Recruiting Message

To recruit participants, we posted on the Facebook group and Instagram page.

> Hi everyone! 🥳We are a group of undergraduate students at UC Berkeley. We want to invite you to participate in a study of coloring experience on brushes with different tips.
> During the study, you will be given a drawing 🎨and three brushes 🖌️ with different brush tips (in shapes) to use to color. You can color the drawing in your own style. Study participation will also consist of a 10-minute 🕒interview to answer questions about your experience. We’re not giving out any monetary compensation, but instead you’ll get to keep the artwork you colored after you're done!
> If you are interested in participating, please fill out this Google Form link. Feel free to reply to this message or email us.

## Synthesis

Preference for a certain brush (ellipse) over the other two. Participants found ellipse brush the easiest to handle, such as coloring narrower areas,
filling the gaps, or coloring certain shapes. In other words it was the easiest brush to control and the result was more precise than the other two
(they were closer to what the participants desired). Having more control on the tool not only produced more satisfactory results but also led to faster coloring in time.

Users tend to be consistent with coloring connected shapes. Users tend to fill shapes (open area) with one color before changing to a different shape
with a different color. People tend to be consistent with how they distribute the drawing for coloring. For example, participants were consistent about dividing
the drawing into parts as ears, body, cheese, and belly and colored each part with the same color within the drawing even though their color palettes changed.

## Sketch Synthesis

Our sketches share a similar toolbar consisting of features including an ellipse brush, size & angle adjustments, a color picker,
and a save button. We also agreed on implementing tips and guides as effective features for new users to learn and use our drawing
application. One team member suggested having a mouse wheel control the size and angle of the brush. While we think this is a
great idea, this feature could be changed depending on the spare time we are given for the project.

## Findings from Usability Study

<UsabilityTest />

## Reflection & Synthesis

We learned that the parts we initially expected to be intuitive can still be confusing to the users while observing their
interaction on our prototype. We designed our interface aiming for clear navigation, so that users can use and utilize every page.
We think we succeeded in this part because they followed the exact steps of what we planned. One unexpected part from the user was that they found the toolbar
at the bottom of our canvas page confusing. They mentioned how the purpose of some icons in the toolbar were not clear and
needed to be simple. Users suggested having a color palette in the toolbar for people who do not have a good sense of color
combinations. These observations will help us acknowledge what users would love and expect to have on a coloring app.
We would like to improve our prototype again to be more user-friendly and intuitive based on our usability test and study.

## Revised Figma Prototype

### Change 1

Users said that the three cards at the home page seem unnecessary. Although having three cards might be useful for first time
users, this feature would be repetitive and unnecessary for frequent users. Therefore, we decided to add a button on each card
to allow users to dismiss them.

### Change 2

While on the canvas users were confused with the zoom in and zoom out button, specifically with its usage and function.
We think that it was confusing since it is inside the tool bar, leading the user to think of it as one of the tools for coloring.
We decided to move it out from the toolbar to make it more visually clear that it’s for the canvas zoom in and zoom out.

### Change 3

Users suggested that they like to have an option to customize their palette.
We added more colors to be shown on the palette and let the users add/remove the colors. These colors will be saved.

## Interactive Prototype

### Description of the interface and interactions

Our home screen navigates to three main pages and notifies users with updated features. In the templates page, users can choose
templates to color which navigate to canvas. Our canvas has ellipse brush as default, but users can customize brush shape and
angle by their preference. We have a customizable eraser and color palette where users can pick, save, and delete colors.
Once they’re done, they can download their work. Portfolio page is where users can view their saved works.
Users can share their work to the community page, where they can view popular drawings from others.

### Pain points

We found out users had struggles with changing tool styles while coloring. To ease this, we put sliders where they can easily
modify brush styles while using it. We also discovered users had a palette they use consistently. If they wanted to use a color
from the past, they had to pick that color again if they changed colors in between. Thus, we added a color palette where users
can freely pick, save, and delete colors to keep their palette. For even better experience, we added keyboard shortcuts for
users to only focus on coloring without leaving the coloring area.
