> TLDR: My deep dive into native macOS development with SwiftUI. Check out [Drag-N-Convert](https://drag-n-convert.vercel.app) - where drag-and-drop meets blazing-fast image conversion! 🚀

## Why Drag-N-Converter?

As a designer-developer hybrid, I found myself constantly juggling between different image formats. While there are countless online converters out there, they often come with frustrating limitations - rate limits that kick in just when you need them most, aggressive ads that play hide-and-seek with the download button, or interfaces that feel like they're stuck in 2005.

My [first attempt](/blog/introducing-image-converter) at solving this was an Electron-based app. While it got the job done, the perfectionist in me wasn't satisfied. I wanted something more elegant, more native, and most importantly - faster!

## Designer's Dilemma

Let's dive into what "converting images" really means in a designer's workflow. Here are some real-world scenarios that drove the development of Drag-N-Converter:

### 1. Figma Export Conundrum

While Figma is amazing at what it does, it's still living in the PNG/JPG era when it comes to exports. Want to export directly to WebP or AVIF? This forces designers into a two-step dance: export from Figma, then convert to modern formats. Not exactly a smooth workflow, right?

### 2. Web Performance Puzzle

Modern web frameworks like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) are fantastic with their built-in image optimization using [next/image](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image) and [sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp). But here's the catch - those original high-res PNGs are still sitting in your repo, taking up precious space. When your project grows from a few dozen images to hundreds, you're suddenly looking at significant storage bloat.

### 3. Context-Switching Chaos

Opening a converter app -> importing images -> waiting for conversion -> saving files - it's death by a thousand clicks! What if the converter could just... appear when you need it and vanish when you're done? 🪄

## "Aha!" Moment

Enter [Yoink](https://eternalstorms.at/yoink/mac) - a brilliant piece of macOS software that revolutionized file management. Its genius lies in its contextual presence - it's there when you need it, invisible when you don't. This sparked an idea: what if we could bring this same magical UX to image conversion?

## Technical Canvas

### Native SwiftUI Magic

![Drag-n-Converter UI](/assets/blog/a-tool-for-designers-drag-n-converter/drag-n-converter-ui.webp)

SwiftUI isn't just a framework - it's a canvas that brings native macOS aesthetics to life. The magic happens with just a few lines of code:

```swift title="DropZoneView"
struct DropZoneView: View {
  @EnvironmentObject private var viewModel: AppViewModel

  var body: some View {
    VStack(spacing: 6) {
      // ...
    }
    .padding(6)
    .frame(width: 420)
    .background(.regularMaterial)
    .clipShape(.rect(cornerRadius: 36, style: .continuous))
  }
}
```

### The Art of the Drop Zone

The PresetDropZoneView is where the magic happens. It's not just a rectangle - it's an interactive canvas that responds to your every move:

```swift title="PresetDropZoneView"
struct PresetDropZoneView: View {
  let preset: ConversionPreset
  let isHovered: Bool

  let columns = [
    GridItem(.flexible()),
    GridItem(.flexible()),
  ]

  var body: some View {
    HStack {
      VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 6) {
        Text(preset.nickname)
          .font(.system(.subheadline, design: .rounded, weight: .medium))
          .lineLimit(1)

        LazyVGrid(columns: columns, alignment: .leading, spacing: 6) {
          PresetInfoRow(title: "F", value: "\(preset.format.rawValue.uppercased())")
          PresetInfoRow(title: "W", value: "\(Int(preset.maxWidth))")
          PresetInfoRow(title: "H", value: "\(Int(preset.maxHeight))")
          PresetInfoRow(title: "Q", value: "\(Int(preset.quality))")
        }
        if preset.outputPath != nil {
          PresetInfoRow(title: "L", value: "\(preset.outputPath!)")
        } else {
          PresetInfoRow(title: "L", value: "Current Path")
        }
      }
      Spacer()
    }
    .padding(20)
    .frame(minWidth: 132, maxWidth: .infinity)
    .background {
      RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 30, style: .continuous)
        .fill(
          LinearGradient(
            gradient: Gradient(colors: [
              isHovered
                ? .accentColor.opacity(0.04)
                : Color.secondary.opacity(0.04),
              isHovered
                ? .accentColor.opacity(0.12)
                : Color.secondary.opacity(0.12),
            ]),
            startPoint: .top,
            endPoint: .bottom
          )
        )

    }
    .overlay {
      ZStack {
        RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 30, style: .continuous)
          .strokeBorder(
            isHovered ? Color.accentColor : .secondary.opacity(0.1),
            lineWidth: isHovered ? 2 : 0.5
          )
      }
    }
    .animation(.easeInOut(duration: 0.15), value: isHovered)
    .onChange(of: isHovered) { oldValue, newValue in
      if newValue {
        NSHapticFeedbackManager.defaultPerformer.perform(
          .alignment, performanceTime: .default)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Global Drag Listener

Since the app is MacOS native, registering a global drag listener for image files is possible (not the easiest task, but definitely easier than bridging to Electron).

```swift title="DragMonitor"
import Cocoa
import UniformTypeIdentifiers

@MainActor
final class DragMonitor: ObservableObject {
  @Published private(set) var isDraggingImages = false
  private var monitor: Any?
  private var lastChangeCount: Int = 0
  private let dragPasteboard = NSPasteboard(name: .drag)

  private static let fileOptions: [NSPasteboard.ReadingOptionKey: Any] = [
    .urlReadingFileURLsOnly: true,
    .urlReadingContentsConformToTypes: [UTType.image.identifier],
    NSPasteboard.ReadingOptionKey(rawValue: "NSPasteboardURLReadingSecurityScopedFileURLsKey"):
      kCFBooleanTrue as Any,
  ]

  init() {
    lastChangeCount = dragPasteboard.changeCount
    setupMonitor()
  }

  deinit {
    if let monitor = monitor {
      NSEvent.removeMonitor(monitor)
    }
  }

  private func setupMonitor() {
    monitor = NSEvent.addGlobalMonitorForEvents(matching: [.leftMouseDragged, .leftMouseUp]) {
      [weak self] event in
      Task { @MainActor [weak self] in
        guard let self = self else { return }

        switch event.type {
        case .leftMouseDragged:
          if !self.isDraggingImages {
            let changeCount = self.dragPasteboard.changeCount
            if changeCount != self.lastChangeCount {
              self.lastChangeCount = changeCount
              self.checkForImageFiles()
            }
          }

        case .leftMouseUp:
          self.isDraggingImages = false
          self.lastChangeCount = self.dragPasteboard.changeCount

        default:
          break
        }
      }
    }
  }

  private func checkForImageFiles() {
    if dragPasteboard.canReadObject(forClasses: [NSURL.self], options: Self.fileOptions),
      let urls = dragPasteboard.readObjects(forClasses: [NSURL.self], options: Self.fileOptions)
        as? [URL],
      !urls.isEmpty
    {
      isDraggingImages = true
    }
  }

  func getImageURLs() -> [URL]? {
    guard isDraggingImages,
      dragPasteboard.canReadObject(forClasses: [NSURL.self], options: Self.fileOptions),
      let urls = dragPasteboard.readObjects(forClasses: [NSURL.self], options: Self.fileOptions)
        as? [URL],
      !urls.isEmpty
    else {
      return nil
    }
    return urls
  }
}
```

## Presets: Your Conversion Time Machine

Think of presets as your personal conversion time machines. They remember your perfect settings so you don't have to! The preset system supports:

![Presets](/assets/blog/a-tool-for-designers-drag-n-converter/presets.webp)

- **Format Flexibility**: PNG, JPEG, WebP, HEIF (with AVIF coming soon!)
- **Smart Sizing**: Intelligent dimension constraints
- **Quality Control**: Fine-tuned compression settings
- **Custom Destinations**: Personalized output paths

## Native Advantage

### Accessibility That Just Works

SwiftUI's native components come with built-in accessibility support. VoiceOver, keyboard navigation - it's all there out of the box. No ARIA attributes to wrestle with!

### Localization on Autopilot

The new String Catalog in SwiftUI is mind-blowing! 🤯 Forget managing translation files manually - SwiftUI automatically extracts localizable strings and handles complex pluralization rules. It's like having a mini localization team built into Xcode!

![String Catalog](/assets/blog/a-tool-for-designers-drag-n-converter/xcode-string-catalog.webp)

### Butter-Smooth Animations

SwiftUI's animation system makes everything feel alive:

```swift
withAnimation(.spring(response: 0.3, dampingFraction: 0.8)) {
    // Magic happens here
}
```

## The Icon Easter Egg

I may have spent an unreasonable amount of time on the app icon (we're talking days, not hours). There's a hidden easter egg in there - can you spot it? Hint: does the picture look familiar? 👀

<div className='flex justify-center max-w-64 w-full mx-auto'>

</div>

## Road Ahead

The journey doesn't end here! Here's what's cooking in the lab:

- [x] Multi-dimension export wizardry
- [x] Yoink-style drag-out functionality
- [x] AVIF support for next-gen compression
- [x] Mind-bending state transitions
- [ ] And many more surprises! 🎁
